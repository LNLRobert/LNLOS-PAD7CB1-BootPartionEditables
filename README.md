# LNLOS-PAD7CB1-BootPartionEditables
For the PAD7 when installing with vanilla debian, there are two files that need to be edited


This is in reference to a vanilla setup of a debian distro configuration of a PAD7 installed with CB1. On the boot partition there are two files that need to be edited. This is no longer necessary to do as a manual process as of LNLOS v1.0.7, but is kept here for posterity and reference.
